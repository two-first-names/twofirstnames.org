### Step One: Concept
The first and most basic element of your character is their
concept. Think of this as a short phrase encapsulating the basic
essence of the character — the sort of thing you might see in a
movie synopsis or on the back cover of a novel. Maybe they’re a
“Mercenary to the Gods” or “High Priestess of Santa Muerte.”

Part of a Hero’s concept is their divine patron and 
genesis (Hero, p. 17). Even if you don’t explicitly call 
them out in the concept, you should settle on them now.

This concept doesn’t have any direct mechanical effects,
but any time you find yourself stuck further on in this
process, returning to your concept can help you figure out
the best choice for your character.

### Step Two: Paths
Define three Paths (Origin, p. 95) for your character.
The first Path corresponds to your character’s origin, who they
were before the story started. The second corresponds to their
role, who they are now (your character’s concept is usually a
good fit here). The third corresponds to their pantheon, how
they relate to the gods and myths of their patron’s pantheon.

Each Path consists of the following elements:

- A short description of the Path (e.g. “Moscow Ballet
  Veteran” or “Field Primatologist”
- Three Skills associated with the Path. Which three
  Skills you choose are up to you, but you should be
  prepared to justify non-obvious choices like Culture for
  “Raised by Wolves.” Two of the Skills you choose for
  your character’s Pantheon Path must be the Pantheon
  Skills for divine patron’s pantheon. Any given Skill
  can be associated with at most two of your Paths
- A Path Condition that triggers when you invoke the Path
  too often. You can choose one of the example Conditions
  or use them as a template to create your own.

### Step Three: Skills
Prioritize your characters’ Paths as primary, second-
ary, and tertiary. Your character receives three dots in each
Skill associated with their primary Path, two dots in each
Skill associated with their secondary path, and one dot in
each Skill associated with their tertiary path. These dots
are cumulative for Skills associated with two Paths.

For every Skill that ends up with three or more dots,
choose a Specialty (Origin, p. 59).

### Step Four: Attributes
Your character begins with a single dot in all Attributes
for free.

Prioritize the three Arenas (Origin, p. 97) as primary,
secondary, or tertiary. Assign six dots to Attributes in the primary
category, four to the secondary, and two to the tertiary. Divide these
dots however you like, but no Attribute can be higher than five.

Next, choose one of the three Approaches (Origin,
p. 97). Add two dots to each Attribute in that
Approach; any Attribute dots beyond 5 may be reassigned
elsewhere in the high Attribute’s Arena.

### Step Five: Callings and Knacks
Choose three Callings (Hero, p. 190). At least one of your
character’s Callings must come from their divine patron’s
three Favored Callings.

Your character receives seven[^callingdots] dots among all their
Callings, but each must have at least one dot.

For each Calling, choose a number of Heroic Knacks
equal to the Calling’s rating; while they can learn more,
they may only have as many active as they have Calling dots.
Alternately, you may choose a single Immortal Knack instead
of two Heroic Knacks for any Calling two dots or higher. If
your character is also a creature of Legend, they replace one
Calling with one appropriate to their nature (see Hero, p. 310).

[^callingdots]: Five, plus two for being Legend 5 at game start.

### Step Six: Birthrights
Your character receives seven dots to allocate to
Birthrights (Hero p. 201). You may choose from the example
Birthrights in this book, or design your own.

Most Scions receive Birthrights tied to their patron’s
pantheon, but the Overworld is a cosmopolitan place — not
only do the pantheons routinely talk and trade amongst
themselves, many Gods are members of multiple pantheons. 
If you have an interesting idea for a story about, say, a
Scion of Sun Wukong who carries the Spear of Lugh, don’t
let pantheon affiliation stand in your way.

### Step Seven: Purviews
Your character gains their Pantheon Specialty Purview
as an innate Purview (Hero, p. 264). In addition, choose one of
your divine patron’s Purviews as an innate Purview. All
other Purviews must be drawn from Relics or Guides.

### Step Eight: Boons
Choose five[^boons] Boons from any of your character’s
Purviews, whether innate or granted by Birthrights.

### Step Nine: Finishing Touches
To finish out your character, fill in the following:
- Legend: 1

- Virtues: From the appropriate pantheon. Your char-
  acter begins in the center of the Virtue track.

- Health: One slot each for Bruised, Injured, Maimed,
  and Taken Out; add an additional Bruised slot if your
  character’s Stamina is 3-4, or two additional Bruised
  Slots if their Stamina is 5.

- Defense: Based on a character’s Physical Resilience
  Attribute (Stamina, Resolve, and Composure). Just
  note the Defensive pool the character will roll when
  they take a Defensive action; generally, this is based
  on Stamina, but determined or calm and collected
  characters may avoid attacks with equal alacrity.

Each player character receives 5 extra Skill dots, an extra 
Attribute dot, and either two additional Knacks or four
points of Birthrights at this point in character creation.

Finally, spend 100 Experience as you wish.
