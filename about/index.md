![A cute picture of me, hi!](/img/joe.png)

I'm just a hot mess of an enby from the UK, really.

Currently, I work at the Government Digital Service doing site reliability type stuff, more than happy to chat about public sector/devops/all that fun kinds of stuff! I am also an LGBT+ advocate and network lead, pushing the Gay Agenda to its limits!

Outside of work, I (try to) build awesome stuff, read, play games, cuddle my dog, roleplay. Who knows, maybe this will be a good way to share all that.

This is my best girl; Peggy, a Cardigan Corgi-Toy Poodle bundle of joy. At the time of taking this photo, she was about 18 months, she's getting so big!
